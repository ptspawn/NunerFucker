# NunsAndGuns

First game for code Academy - No convent is safe ever again

Group project developed in less than a week of off hours coding and with only with 3 weeks of Java
Quite proud of the result, but needs a serious refactoring and improvement

Designed to run on a 1920x1080 screen. Sorry about that... will be the first improvement! Promise!

### UNDER DEVELOPMENT ###

To do:
- Adapt to any screen (a must!);
- Animation Sprites (couldn't do it in a week, sorry);
- Boss mechanics and improved enemy behaviour;
- More weapons!!!!
- More buffs!
